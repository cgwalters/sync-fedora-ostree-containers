# Automatic sync of Fedora silverblue containers

This is a temporary repository until https://pagure.io/releng/issue/11047
is merged/implemented.

This repository automatically polls the Fedora OSTree
repositories for Fedora Silverblue and generates container images.

They're published at `ghcr.io/cgwalters/fedora-silverblue:36` and
`ghcr.io/cgwalters/fedora-silverblue:37`.
